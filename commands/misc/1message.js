              Happy 68th birthday, Lars! In just one year from now you'll become a real man. So difficult to believe! Jest aside, in my short history of playing poker, you were the first player to win my respect! And I shouldn't even get started on how important you have been and continue to be on the Study Vibes server!
              
              Now, this birthday wish won't have the "Abhishek"-feel without a joke. So here's one especially for you:
              
              A German-speaking person and a Dutch-speaking person enter a bar. They both get extremely drunk, and exit the bar as two Dutch-speakers.
